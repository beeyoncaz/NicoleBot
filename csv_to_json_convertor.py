    "Review Texts": ['I’ve been using the Beats Solo 4 in Cloud Pink for a few days now, mainly at the gym, and I love them. They’re super stylish and the color is really nice. The material and build quality feel very solid and well-made.\nThe sound is great with clear highs and strong bass, perfect for working out. They’re also very comfortable to wear, even during long sessions. They feel simple but strong, not too bulky, and they stay in place while moving.\nThe battery life is amazing too. I’ve only charged them once so far even with daily use. Overall, I’m really happy with them and they’ve become my go-to gym headphones.\n\n\nRead more', "My husband just surprised me with the Beats Solo 4, and I’m genuinely impressed. The sound quality is crisp, with deep bass and well-balanced mids and highs, perfect for everything from hip-hop to podcasts. These headphones deliver a premium listening experience that makes my daily workouts and much needed down time so much more enjoyable.\nThe Bluetooth connection is seamless and rock-solid, with no dropouts or lag. Pairing with my iPhone was instant, and the integration with Apple devices is super smooth. Battery life is also a major win, I’m easily getting hours and hours on a single charge, which is incredible for wireless headphones in this category.\nComfort-wise, the on-ear design is lightweight and surprisingly gentle, even during long listening sessions. The ear cushions are soft and breathable, and the adjustable headband feels sturdy without being too tight.\nThe build quality feels premium, and the folding design makes them easy to store in my bag. Plus, they look stylish without being too flashy.\nIf you're looking for wireless headphones that combine great sound, comfort, and reliability, the Beats Solo 4 are a top-notch choice. Trust me when I say, I never knew I needed them until now and there is no way I can go back to my Airpods after having these. Highly recommended!\n\n\nRead more", 'The audio is insanely clear with rich bass and clean highs. Super comfortable for hours of use, and the battery lasts all day. Easy to pair and stylish too. These are my go-to headphones for everything!\n\n\nRead more', "I absolutely love these headphones, especially the beautiful blue color! It’s so refreshing to see options beyond the typical black, gray, or white. I originally bought them as a birthday gift for a family member, and he couldn’t be happier with them. It was a great price, the sound was clear and high quality and they are very durable.\nHe used to use Sony headphones but mentioned they were starting to hurt his ears and even causing some hearing discomfort. Since switching to these, he’s had no ear pain, and he’s really impressed with the sound quality. He wears them for about 8 hours a day and still finds them comfortable, which says a lot.\nHonestly, after seeing how much he enjoys them, I’m thinking about getting a pair for myself too!\nPros:\n- Unique and stylish color options (love the blue!)\n- Comfortable for long-term wear (no ear pain)\n- Excellent sound quality\n- Great for all-day use\n- Thoughtful gift option\nCons:\n- Limited availability in retail stores—mostly online\n- May not have all the advanced features of high-end brands\nThese headphones check all the boxes for comfort, style, and sound. If you're looking for something that looks great and feels even better, especially for long listening sessions, these are a fantastic choice. Highly recommend!\n\n\nRead more", 'These headphones sound pretty average but I am not that picky on sound. I thought they were a little tight in the ears. I am a little sensitive though. Bluetooth connection is quick and stable, and the battery lasts a long time between charges. They feel well-made and look sleek too. Great value for the price\n\n\nRead more', 'This is my first time trying Beats headphones and I am impressed. For a while I have been using in ear headphones but when I kept losing them I was like ok I think it’s time for a change. The sound of these beats are great and the over the head comfort is nice. But, you can’t leave these on your ears for a long time for they start to feel uncomfortable which kind of takes away from the listening experience. These are lightweight, the design is sleek and nice, and connects quickly to Bluetooth. Also there is a cord that comes with it that you can plug into your computer jack for a clearer sound. It’s nice.\n\n\nRead more', 'The Beats Solo 4 headphones are absolutely fantastic! The sound quality is top-notch, with deep bass and crisp highs that make every song come alive. The Bluetooth connection is seamless, and the battery life is impressive, lasting all day on a single charge. The design is sleek and stylish, and the on-ear fit is comfortable even during extended use. These headphones are perfect for music lovers who want both performance and style. Highly recommend them!\n\n\nRead more', 'This was a gift for my niece and let me tell you she is obsessed with these headphones. First of all the color is great and the sound quality is amazing. I tried them on and heard a little bit of music and I was able to activate noise cancellation just like the AirPods these headphones made a perfect gift for her because she likes to go to the gym. I asked her if they wouldn’t fall off her head while she was running on the treadmill or working out and she said they stayed on her and didn’t sip off. The quality of the battery is amazing. She said that the headphones charged quick and the battery life last about three days.\nThe button makes it easier for her to work out and listen to music at the same time. After hearing all these good things and how excited she was, it was definitely worth the money that I paid.\n\n\nRead more', 'I\'m a huge headphone collector always looking for good quality sets. A very long time ago I used to own the first beats generation whose quality was amazing... over time I started using other sets and brands like Sony, Bose, etc.. I have a lot of sets for particular purposes. Yes is right that these don\'t come with noise cancelling and that music doesn\'t stop when you take them off... but I was not looking for any high end/premium headphones, but instead something more simple, classic, that could deliver good sound quality. It is also true that its bass is not what it used to be, but this is to help to provide a better and more crisp sound. Apple indeed made a downgrade and I\'m not a full fan of downgrading bass, but being able to use the spatial sound feature in these is great, it makes music much more enjoyable with clear vocals and you can actually distinguish instruments better than just having a full blast on the bass.\nAgain, I wasn\'t going for a noise cancelling set, and its "passive" noise cancelling is good enough (not for very loud places like airplanes though) but that\'s why I have other sets in case I want noise cancelling.\nThis stays on pretty well while working out and even though is not specified it does feel sweat resistance and they feel pretty comfortable.\nLove their size btw, small, compact enough to fit in a my already bulky backpack. It came with a very nice case/pack where I can fill with a few more stuff, so that\'s a big plus.\nNot sure other models, but I loved my blue ones.\nNow... even though they feel quite comfortable, not sure they would be in the long run... they get a little less comfortable after an hour of use or so, bringing a little pressure in your ears, particularly the right side near the charging port (something odd about it makes it uncomfortable). Cushion is not as stiff like other brands, but it\'s ok... not the best, but manageable.\nOverall I do give these a 5 star because of the price/quality value, their sound quality, durability, and how convenient this are.\nIs probably not a must buy, but I would buy them again.\nnote: My wife tried them and now she wants a pair too LOL, she loved them... So will buy another set just for her.\n\n\nRead more', 'Excelente producto la caja muy golpeada pero el resto 10/10 si el embalaje estuviese en mejores condiciones le daría 5 estrellas pero el producto justo lo que promete\n\n\nRead more', 'Bought for teenager. Very good sound and quality. Comfortable. Easily adjusts to fit. Great for car rides and on airplane.\n\n\nRead more', 'Great headphones, comfy, noise cancelling, stay on while hitting the heavy bag/ boxing\n\n\nRead more', 'Noise cancelling, they work great\n\n\nRead more'],
